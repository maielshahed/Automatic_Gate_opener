The project simulates a garage that allows a certain number of cars. If there is a car, the gate is opened and it enters. 
Then there is a counter to write the number of cars that are supposed to enter the garage until it is full.
It has been built with several hardware drivers, such  LCD driver,timer driver. 
This project contains multiple hardware items, including an ATmega32 microcontroller, LCD, ultrasonic sensor, and servo moto,7 segment common cathode,7447 IC â€“ BCD to 7 Segment Decoder
